## What is TrailCurrent?

TrailCurrent is a **reference implementation** of an **Open Source Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Platform** for comprehensive monitoring, control, autonomous decision-making, and intelligent management of mobile systems. It's designed to be broadly applicable to a wide variety of vehicle types including RVs, trailers, boats, aircraft, and other mobile platforms.

Unlike traditional IoT platforms, TrailCurrent is specifically architected for **autonomous vehicle intelligence** with:
- **Safety-first design** - Physical wired controls for all critical functions
- **Local autonomous intelligence** - AI/ML components running on edge compute making real-time decisions
- **Complete vehicle autonomy** - Full functionality without cloud or internet
- **Software-defined behavior** - Programmable, intelligent vehicle behavior via open-source software
- **Complete data sovereignty** - All data stays under user control, no vendor lock-in

**⚠️ This is NOT production-ready commercial software.** Users must conduct extensive testing, validation, and modification for their specific use cases. It consists of:

- **Multiple ESP32-based Hardware Modules** for sensing, monitoring, and control
- **In-Vehicle Compute System** for edge processing and gateway functionality (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Jetson Nano, or similar)
- **Cloud Application** for remote monitoring, analytics, and management
- **Android Mobile App** for user interaction
- **Docker-based Infrastructure** for deployment and scaling

## Key Concepts

### CAN Bus Network
Hardware modules communicate via CAN bus protocol for reliable, real-time data exchange.

### MQTT Gateway
The in-vehicle compute system converts CAN messages to MQTT, enabling both local wireless connectivity (when internet is unavailable) and cloud integration (when connected). This allows the vehicle to operate autonomously during travels through areas with no WAN connectivity, then sync data with the cloud when connection is restored.

### Docker Infrastructure
Services run in Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments.

### OTA Updates
Firmware updates are distributed over-the-air to hardware modules.

### Cloud is Optional
The in-vehicle compute system operates completely independently. Cloud connectivity is entirely optional - vehicles function with full autonomy using local MQTT messaging. When you choose to connect to a cloud, it's **your private cloud**, hosted wherever and however you prefer.

### Data Privacy First
All vehicle data stays on your hardware. TrailCurrent is designed to **never require or send data to third-party services**. There is no vendor lock-in, no cloud accounts with big tech companies, no tracking. Complete data sovereignty.

### 100% Open Source
Every component of TrailCurrent is open source: firmware, hardware designs (CAD/EDA), backend code, frontend code, tools, and utilities. This ensures transparency, prevents lock-in, and enables community contributions.
