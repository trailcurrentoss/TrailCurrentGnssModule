1. TrailCurrent is a reference implementation provided AS-IS without warranties
2. You have read and understand [LIABILITY_AND_DISCLAIMER.md](../../LIABILITY_AND_DISCLAIMER.md)
3. Your contributions do not create liability for you or original creators for user outcomes

## Core Mission

TrailCurrent is built on **three fundamental principles** that **must be preserved in every contribution**:

### 1. ⚪ Cloud is Optional
- The system must work **completely independently** without any cloud connection
- Users should never be forced or pressured to use cloud services
- Cloud features are purely **opt-in enhancements**
- Test all features in **offline mode** first

### 2. 🔐 Data Privacy First
- Vehicle data must **never be sent to third-party services** without explicit user consent
- **NO Big Tech APIs** allowed (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) without user awareness
- **NO tracking, telemetry, or analytics** that phone home
- Users must have **complete control** over where their data goes
- If you propose a cloud feature, it must be **self-hostable and private**

### 3. 📖 100% Open Source
- All code, firmware, designs, and tools must be **openly licensed**
- No proprietary components or closed-source dependencies
- No license lock-in or vendor restrictions
- Include source code for all CAD files, EDA schematics, and designs
- Use only open-source tools and standards

## Before You Code

**Ask yourself:**
- Does this feature require the cloud? If yes, is it truly optional?
- Does this feature send data anywhere? If yes, is the user in control?
- Does this add a proprietary dependency? If yes, is there an open-source alternative?
- Would this break offline functionality? If yes, reconsider the design.

**If the answer to any concern is unclear, discuss it in an issue first.**

## Code Guidelines

### For All Code

1. **Maintain Offline-First Design**
   - All features must work locally first
   - Cloud sync is secondary
   - No internet required for core functionality

2. **No External Dependencies**
   - Avoid proprietary APIs and cloud services
   - If a service is needed, it must be self-hostable
   - Document why the dependency is necessary
   - Provide open-source alternatives when possible

3. **Privacy by Default**
   - No data collection without explicit user consent
   - No telemetry or diagnostics that leave the vehicle
   - No analytics or crash reporting to external services
   - Users control their data completely

4. **Open Source Everything**
   - All dependencies must have compatible open-source licenses
   - No trial/freemium services with paywalls
   - No SaaS-only tools without offline alternatives

### Hardware/CAD Files

- Include **editable source files** (not just rendered models)
- Use open-source tools (KiCad for EDA, FreeCAD for mechanical)
- Document all part numbers and sources
- No proprietary hardware requirements

### Firmware (C/C++)

- Use **ESP-IDF** (open-source framework)
- No proprietary libraries or SDKs
- Document all CAN messages and MQTT topics
- Ensure OTA updates work independently

### Control Modules (Critical Safety Requirement!)

⚠️ **ANY module that controls vehicle critical functions (motors, fans, lights, heaters, levelers, etc.) MUST have:**

1. **Primary: Wired CAN Bus Control**
   - CAN interface for reliable hardwired control
   - No wireless dependency for critical operations
   - Works even if all other systems fail

2. **Secondary: Physical Controls**
   - Hardwired switches or buttons
   - Manual override capability
   - No network required for basic operation

3. **Optional: Cloud/WiFi Enhancement**
   - ONLY after wired control is implemented
   - NEVER the only control method
   - ALWAYS has fallback to physical control

**Examples:**
- ✅ Heater: Physical switch + CAN control + optional WiFi
- ✅ Leveler: Physical panel buttons + CAN control + optional remote
- ✅ Fan: Hardwired relay + CAN control + optional automation
- ❌ Any device with ONLY WiFi/Cloud control

### Backend (Node.js)

- Use **Express.js** with open-source packages
- No cloud vendor lock-in (no Firebase, DynamoDB, etc.)
- All data storage must be user-controllable (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- No external authentication services required (optional: OAuth, but with self-hosted option)
- **For control features**: ensure local CAN/MQTT control works even if cloud is down

### Frontend

- Pure **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (no heavy framework lock-in)
- Works **offline with local MQTT**
- No external CDNs required for core functionality
- No telemetry or analytics

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and branch** - Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. **Code following guidelines** - Ensure all principles are maintained
3. **Test offline** - Verify features work without internet
4. **Document changes** - Update relevant documentation
5. **Commit with good messages** - Explain the why, not just the what
6. **Create PR** - Link related issues, explain your changes

### PR Description Template

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers will check:

- ✅ Offline functionality - Does it work without cloud?
- ✅ Data privacy - Is any data sent externally? If so, is user in control?
- ✅ Open source - Are all dependencies open source?
- ✅ No vendor lock-in - Is this tied to a specific provider?
- ✅ Documentation - Are changes documented?
- ✅ Architecture - Does this align with platform design?

## Issues You Can Help With

Look for issues tagged with:
- `good-first-issue` - Great for new contributors
- `help-wanted` - Community input needed
- `documentation` - Improve docs and guides
- `offline-mode` - Enhance offline capabilities
- `open-source` - Add open-source alternatives

## Reporting Bugs

```

## Questions?

- **Architecture questions** - Open an issue to discuss design
- **Privacy concerns** - Always flag potential data leaks
- **Open source issues** - Report proprietary dependencies
- **General questions** - Join our community forums

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, inclusive, and thoughtful. We welcome contributions from all backgrounds and experience levels.

## License

All contributions must be licensed under the project's license (typically GPL v3 or MIT). By submitting code, you agree to this licensing.

## Special Notes for New Developers

⚠️ **IMPORTANT** - Please read and understand these three principles:

1. **Cloud is optional** - test offline first
2. **Data is private** - never send to third parties
3. **Everything is open source** - no proprietary code or tools

If you're unsure whether a feature aligns with these principles, **ask in an issue first**. It's better to discuss before coding than to have a PR rejected.

## Thank You!

Your contributions help make TrailCurrent better while preserving the values that make it special - privacy, independence, and open source.
