## Prerequisites

- Edge compute device (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Orange Pi, or similar for in-vehicle compute)
- One or more ESP32 development boards (for hardware modules)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js 24+ (for backend development)
- Basic understanding of networking and embedded systems

## 1. Understanding the System (2 min)

TrailCurrent is an **Open Source Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) Platform with Autonomous Intelligence** - not just another IoT project. It's specifically designed for intelligent vehicle control, autonomous decision-making, and comprehensive management.

**Three Essential Layers:**
1. **Vehicle Devices** (ESP32 modules) - Sensors, controllers, gateways communicating via hardwired CAN bus
2. **Vehicle Edge Compute** (Raspberry Pi/Orange Pi/etc.) - Autonomous intelligence system with local AI/ML for real-time decision-making, control, and autonomous operation
3. **Optional Cloud** (Self-hosted) - Remote monitoring, analytics, and management - completely optional, your private infrastructure

**Key SDV Design Principles:**
- ✅ **Vehicle Autonomy First** - Complete autonomous operation without internet or cloud (full intelligent control)
- ✅ **Local Autonomous Intelligence** - AI/ML components run locally on vehicle, making real-time autonomous decisions without cloud dependency
- ✅ **Safety-Critical Wired Control** - All critical functions have physical wired controls, never WiFi/cloud-only
- ✅ **Data Sovereignty** - Your data stays private, no third-party APIs or cloud lock-in
- ✅ **100% Open Source** - Complete transparency: firmware, CAD designs, schematics, all code

## 2. Your First Steps

Choose your path:

### I want to...

**...understand the overall architecture**
→ Read [01_Architecture/PLATFORM_OVERVIEW.md](01_Architecture/PLATFORM_OVERVIEW.md)

**...develop a hardware module**
→ See [02_Hardware_Modules/README.md](02_Hardware_Modules/README.md) and [07_Development/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](07_Development/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)

**...set up the in-vehicle compute system**
→ Follow [03_Vehicle_Compute/SETUP_GUIDE.md](03_Vehicle_Compute/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**...deploy the cloud application**
→ Go to [04_Cloud_Application/SETUP_GUIDE.md](04_Cloud_Application/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**...run the full system locally**
→ See [07_Development/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](07_Development/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)

**...deploy to production**
→ Check [08_Deployment/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](08_Deployment/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

**...troubleshoot an issue**
→ Search [09_Troubleshooting/COMMON_ISSUES.md](09_Troubleshooting/COMMON_ISSUES.md)
